Got through the basic stuff, will move onto slightly more advanced mateial
from 100. It will be a new program, so I'll create a branch and push the 
branch to github. Try creating several bracnches, get the branches pushed to 
github. Later, pull the github repo to an empty folder to see if main and all
the branches are correct.
